I own Github

Codacy, DeepAffects, Renovate, Hound, Azure Pipelines, Slack + GitHub, LGTM, GitHub Learning Lab, Google Cloud Build, Sonatype DepShield, Octobox, Imgbot, Azure Boards, and Restyled.io and all other Marketplace bots have no part in this.

Also, before Jeff Bezos left his CEO role at Amazon


he gave me ownership of Amazon.
Also the same story with Microsoft and Apple.
